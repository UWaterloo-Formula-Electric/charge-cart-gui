# README #
* This project is not compatible with Mac due to end line issues
* If you are changing the .UI file from the QtDesigner, please work on a mac as they will look differently on Mac.
* DemoGeneratedGUI is the file that generated by Qt designer. 

* As the name says, it is a demo for constructor 
We need to manually add a construct in `charge_cart_GUI.py`, so it is not static class and therefore can be called from child class

```    
class Ui_MainWindow(object):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Ui_MainWindow, self).__init__()
```

* serial_parse contends all the necessary functions for communicating with the board

* charge_cart_GUI.ui is the file from Qt designer

* charge_cart_GUI.py is the generated python file from Qt designer

* charge_cart_GUI_testing.py is in .gitignore for local testing purposes


# Warning
Following is the command to get python file from .ui file

#### Mac
`python3 -m PyQt6.uic.pyuic -o charge_cart_GUI_testing.py -x charge_cart_GUI.ui`

#### Windows
`pyuic6 -x charge_cart_GUI.ui -o charge_cart_GUI_testing.py`

The command will overwrite all the current code in charge_cart_GUI_testing.py 
please add the constructor and test it locally first then update `charge_cart_GUI.py` upon pushing
so don't touch the file except for adding a constructor
OR you know what you are doing
 

# TODO
1. Figure out how to disconnect without killing the main thread.
2. Send setting current request
3. Send balancing pack request
