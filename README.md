# README #

DemoGeneratedGUI is the file that generated by Qt designer. 
We need to manually add a construct so it is not static class and therefore can be called from child class

untitled.ui is the file from Qt desinger

# Warning
Following is the command to get python file from .ui file
python3 -m PyQt6.uic.pyuic -o testing1.py -x untitled.ui
The command will overwrite all the current code so don't touch the file except for adding a constructor
